SharpOS KeyCompiler
Author: William Lahti

Introduction
The SharpOS kernel requires a method of integrating character keymaps into the nanokernel for 
boot-time keyboard/console support. This tool compiles keymaps in the SharpOS Keymap format (.skm)
into binary keymap tables (.sk) which can be loaded and used by the kernel. Keymaps generated by this
tool will also be used by the userspace keyboard support as well as the SharpOS window system. 

Also supported is a basic keymap archive format used to make it easier for us to automate the 
addition and automatic availability of keymaps, without adding explicit code in the kernel. The
format stores each keymap with a string label that represents it's name. The kernel searches
through the archive at runtime to select the keymap requested by the user.

The compiler also supports decoding both binary keymaps (.sk) and keymap archives (.ska) back into
their original forms.
